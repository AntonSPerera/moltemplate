This directory contains examples of all-atom simulations using the DREIDING
force field.

As of 2020-10-19, this software has been tested for consistency between LAMMPS
and Materials Studio using only two simple molecules (butane and ethylene).

This software is experimental and the force-fields and equilbration protocols
have not been tested carefully.  There is no gaurantee that simulations
prepared using moltemplate will reproduce the behavior of Materials Studio
(or other MD codes).

Please report any bugs you find.
