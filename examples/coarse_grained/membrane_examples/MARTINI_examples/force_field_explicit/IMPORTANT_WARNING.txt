WARNING:
   There are two different implementations of the MARTINI lipid model.
One implementation was created by Saeed M Bashusqeh.
The other implementation was created by David Stelter and Pieter J. in â€™t Veld.
I have serious doubts about both of them because:
1) I am concerned that the electrostatic interactions in these examples
may be too strong (by a factor of 20).  (The original Martini paper in
J.Phys.Chem.B 2004 uses an relative electrostatic epsilon of 20. We use 1.)
2) I am uncertain about how many angle interactions should be in each lipid.

The moltemplate developers have historically relied on input from
users to spot bugs in force fields.  There were several mistakes in our
implementations of the OPLSAA, GAFF2, COMPASS, and DREIDING force fields.
However these force fields were popular enough that users have spotted
these mistakes and reported them to us.  Unfortunately, coarse grained
force fields like MARTINI are much less popular, and we haven't received
any feedback from people who use them.

I finally decided to try these examples.
I was not encouraged by the contradictory behavior of these two implementations.

I will either update or remove all of the MARTINI examples in the next
month or two.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THE MARTINI MODEL WITH MOLTEMPLATE UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED.
