# PREREQUISITES
#
# The users should have followed the instructions in STEP_1 and created a
# file named "init_crds_polymer_backbone.raw" containing the positions
# of every monomer in the polymer.

# Use these commands to generate the LAMMPS input script and data file

# --- MAKE SURE THESE PARAMETERS AGREE WITH STEP_1 and "dna_forcefield.lt" ---

L_BOND=6.972           # length of the bonds connecting monomers
L_MONOMER=13.944       # length of each monomer (Note: In this model, each
                       # monomer has 3 particles, and two different bonds
                       # along the backbone.  Hence its length equals 2 bonds.
N_TWIST_MOTORS=400     # number of twist motors to insert into the polymer


# Create LAMMPS input files this way:
cd moltemplate_files


  # Use "genpoly_lt.py" to create a polymer which follows the curve 
  # traced by the coordinates that we copied into this directory earlier.
  # (Note: "genpoly_lt.py" is distributed and installed along with moltemplate.)
  # The "genpoly_lt.py" program generates a moltemplate file (.LT file)
  # describing the polymer you want to simulate.  You must specify the
  # name of the moltemplate object which will be used as the monomer subunit
  # in the final polymer (eg. "DNAMonomer"), as well as any bonds (or angles
  # or dihedrals) linking one monomer to the next monomer, as well as the
  # helical twist angle (if applicable).  All of the details regarding
  # the behaviour of the polymer are contained in the "dnamonomer.lt" file
  # which defines the "DNAMonomer" object, as well as a link to the file
  # which defines "DNAForceField" (which DNAMonomer uses).
  #
  # Notes on the arguments:
  # The "-helix" parameter represents the twist-per-monomer (Δφ) at the
  # start of the simulation.  It is proportional to the "supercoil-density" (σ)
  # The formula for the twist-per-monomer which is:
  #    Δφ = 360*σ*(n_b/10.5)     (in degrees)
  # where n_b is the number of base pairs per monomer, and 10.5 is the
  # natural period of DNA twist in the relaxed state in base-pairs.
  # Example:
  # genpoly_lt.py -helix -72.0 \

  # We are using angle and dihedral interactions who's energy (near the minima)
  # is approximated by:
  #
  #    Ubend(theta) = (k_b/2)*theta^2   
  #    Utorsion(phi) = (k_t/2)*phi^2   
  #         (k_b and k_t in energy/rad^2)
  #
  # For small b, k_b and k_t are proportional to the bending and torsional
  # persistence lengths (L_b and L_t) according to:
  #
  #   L_b/b ~= k_b / kB*T
  #   L_t/b ~= k_t / kB*T
  #
  #   b = n_b * 0.332nm
  #   n_b=the number of base pairs per monomer (typically less than 50)
  #   kB*T=0.001987207*300 (kCal/mole, assuming we are using these energy units)
  #
  # However for numerical stability we must forbid certain angles from being
  # visited, and this requires changing the potential to something slightly more
  # complicated.  The new Ubend(angle) and Utorsion(phi), now have this form:
  #
  # U(theta) = ((2/pi)t_range)^2 * K (-1+1/ cos((theta-theta0)/((2/pi)t_range)))
  #
  # where t_range is the range of allowable angles around the minima at theta0.
  # (See calc_table_angle.py for details.)
  #
  # As a result, the bending and torsional persistence lengths
  # are no longer exactly equal to k_b/kB*T and k_t/kB*T (respectively).
  # To achieve the desired persistence lengths, we must try several different
  # k_b and k_t values and iterate until the desired persistence lengths are
  # reproduced.  The initial iteration (iteration 0) uses the estimate above.

  # How did we choose the TORQUE (twist motor strength) parameter?
  # This would be the torque necessary to introduce a supercoil
  # density of σ (which is usually measured by experiment to be ~ 0.03-0.05).
  # This is difficult to know because it depends on the shape of the polymer.
  # The torque necessary to introduce a supercoil density σ into a straight
  # polymer made from monomers (length b) connected with torsional springs
  # of strength k_t is
  #  torque = k_t * σ*(2*pi/10.5)*(b/0.332)
  # where σ*(2*pi/10.5) is the Δtwist-per-base-pair corresponding to σ, and
  # (b/0.332) is the number of base pairs per monomer (b in monomer length in nm
  # 0.332nm base pair spacing), and 10.5 is the periodicity of DNA (base pairs)
  # ... AND the spring constant is approximated by:
  #     k_t = (L_t/b)*kB*T
  #     L_t = torsional persistence length of DNA
  #    kB*T = 0.001987207*300kCal/mole,
  # Setting b = 10.5*0.332,  and L_t = 111.0:
  #
  # --> torque = k_t*σ*(2*pi/10.5)*(b/0.332) = 5.875137 (kcal/mole)/ radian
  #     torque * 2*pi / (kB*T) = 61.92 kB*T / turn
  #
  # However, this estimate is for a straight polymer.
  # For a curved polymer that contains both twist and writhe, you can
  # estimate the amount of twist in that polymer by measuring the average 
  # torsional angle between successive monomers in that polymer.
  # First we must generate a curved polymer with a known superhelical density σ
  # and with a conformation that you consider to be realistic.  One way to do
  # this is to create a simple, flat circular polymer (with zero writhe)
  # which is already twisted along its axis by an amount consistent with σ.
  # Then allow the polymer to relax slowly. Hopefully the resulting conformation
  # is similar to the desired conformation.  Then measure the twist stored in
  # the polymer by measuring average torsional angle between monomers.
  # (Alternatively you can measure the polymer's writhe from its shape, and
  #  then subtract writhe from the total supercoil density, if it is known.)
  # From the average torsional angle, you can estimate the torque necessary
  # to create that angle between successive monomers.
  # Then we can insert twist motors into the polymer that exert
  # this amount of torque to achieve the same effect.
  # (This is how I obtained the value of TORQUE used above.
  #  See the file "extract_dihedrals_and_infer_torque.sh" for more details.)

  # ---------------- LINKED VERSION -----------------

  # Now create a version of the same circular polymer, but this time
  # add bonds that link the ends of the circular polymer at either end together
  # with the periodic image of the ring polymer on the other side.
  # (In other words, link the origin of replication at one end, with the
  #  terminus of replication at the other end, though the periodic boundary.)
  # This is one of several strategies one could use to keep the polymer under
  # tension as we let the system collapse (contract) using "fix deform".
  # We don't want to just completely let go of the polymer ends, because
  # the polymer needs to be under some kind of tension for the plectonemic
  # supercoils to slowly form along it's length correctly as the tension is
  # relaxed.  Furthermore the polymer needs to be linked in 2 places (not 1)
  # to the polymers on the other side of the periodic boundary.  This is to 
  # prevent the ends of the circle from spinning freely.  Otherwise, the
  # entire circular polymer would simply twist around its own long axis (the
  # x-axis) and form one incredibly long plectonemic supercoil.  (This is not
  # what bacterial nucleoids look like.)  Linking the polymer in 2 nearby
  # places along the chain avoids this.  And this also does a more accurate job
  # of simulating the replication of DNA in Caulobacter crescentus, because
  # in that bacteria either end of the cicular DNA (ie the Ori and Ter regions)
  # are anchored to opposite sides of the cell wall (in a way that would prevent
  # them from freely rotating).  Since there is no cell wall in this model,
  # the only thing left to bind the polymer to its periodic image.
